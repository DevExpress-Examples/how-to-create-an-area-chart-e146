# How to create an Area chart

The following example demonstrates how to create an [Area](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2979/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/2d-series-views/area-series-views/area-chart?p=netframework) chart at runtime.

Note that this series view type is associated with the [XY-Diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/5908/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/diagram/xy-diagram?p=netframework) type, and you should cast your [diagram](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraCharts.ChartControl.Diagram?p=netframework) object to this type, in order to access its specific options.
